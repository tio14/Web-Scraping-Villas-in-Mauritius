# Web-Scraping-Villas-in-Mauritius

I scrapes the data using python programming with the help of several libraries such as request, beautiful soup, regex, and pandas. I have to do a little data manipulation using regex in order to make the data more informative and ready to use. Such as taking the price number in a long formatted text price from the website. I saved the data in a CSV format that can be accessed by Ms. Excel. It took me around 3-4 hour to complete this project. This project still have many more ways to improve. I can standardize the data and combine it as one file. Or adding more useful information such as, maximum person capacity, pool, staff, reviews, etc. The resulting data can be analyzed using Ms. Excel or even more with Power BI.
